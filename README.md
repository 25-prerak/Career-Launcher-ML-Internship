# Career-Launcher-ML-Internship
Tasks completed as a part of my Machine Learning Internship with Career Launcher

During the 6 weeks of my internship, I completed several tasks related to analysis and prediction of stock markets.

Week 1:

In week 1, pandas was used to process and analyse data. Processing included removing unknown values from the data or replacing unknown values with values which make sense, maybe 0. Analysing the data included finding out the trend of a stock price, e.g. how the stock price changes with respect to the Nifty 50 basket of stocks. 

Week 2:

Data Visualization and Technical Analysis
'A picture speaks a thousand words' has never been truer in financial markets. Absolutely no one goes through the millions of rows of numbers, we always prefer the data in a plotted form to draw better inferences. In this module I carried out plotting, then tried to understand basic technical indicators and at the end even tried to make some of my own trade calls!!

Week 3:

Fundamental Analysis through Regression

Regression is basically a statistical approach to find the relationship between variables. In machine learning, this is used to predict the outcome of an event based on the relationship between variables obtained from the data-set. More often than not, we utilize linear regression to come up with an ideal inference. Here I used linear regression to predict the stock/commodity prices. Additionally I also carried out Beta calculation using regression
