# Career-Launcher-ML-Internship
Tasks completed as a part of my Machine Learning Internship with Career Launcher

During the 6 weeks of my internship, I completed several tasks related to analysis and prediction of stock markets. The tasks completed during each week are given below with their corresponding .ipynb files present in the repository.

Week 1:

In week 1, pandas was used to process and analyse data. Processing included removing unknown values from the data or replacing unknown values with values which make sense, maybe 0. Analysing the data included finding out the trend of a stock price, e.g. how the stock price changes with respect to the Nifty 50 basket of stocks. 

Week 2:

Data Visualization and Technical Analysis
'A picture speaks a thousand words' has never been truer in financial markets. Absolutely no one goes through the millions of rows of numbers, we always prefer the data in a plotted form to draw better inferences. In this module I carried out plotting, then tried to understand basic technical indicators and at the end even tried to make some of my own trade calls!!

Week 3:

Fundamental Analysis through Regression

Regression is basically a statistical approach to find the relationship between variables. In machine learning, this is used to predict the outcome of an event based on the relationship between variables obtained from the data-set. More often than not, we utilize linear regression to come up with an ideal inference. Here I used linear regression to predict the stock/commodity prices. Additionally I also carried out Beta calculation using regression. The Beta of an asset is a measure of sensitivity of its returns realtive to a market benchmark (usually a market index like SENSEX,S&P500 etc)

Week 4:

In this week, I carried out trade call prediction through the help of classification algorithms. Through the help of Bollinger Bands 4 classes were considered for classification, namely 'Buy', 'Hold Buy/Liquidate Short', 'Hold Short/Liquidate Buy', 'Short'. Based on these 4 classes the classsficiation model was trained. 

Week 5:

Modern Portfolio Theory
In this module, I looket at investment portfolio optimization with python, the fundamental concept of diversification and the creation of an efficient frontier that can be used by investors to choose specific mixes of assets based on investment goals; that is, the trade off between their desired level of portfolio return vs their desired level of portfolio risk. 
Modern Portfolio Theory suggests that it is possible to construct an "efficient frontier" of optimal portfolios, offering the maximum possible expected return for a given level of risk. It suggests that it is not enough to look at the expected risk and return of one particular stock. By investing in more than one stock, an investor can reap the benefits of diversification, particularly a reduction in the riskiness of the portfolio. MPT quantifies the benefits of diversification, also known as not putting all of your eggs in one basket. 

Week 6:

Clustering for Diversification Analysis
Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields. Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. 
In financial Markets, Cluster analysis is a technique used to group sets of objects that share similar characteristics. It is common in statistics, but investors will use the approach to build a diversified portfolio. Stocks that exhibit high correlations in returns fall into one basket, those slightly less correlated in another, and so on, until each stock is placed into a category.
